# hacker-rank-simpledb

In  May-June 2016 I applied to Thumbtack through HackerRank. Challenge was to create simple Redis-like database with transactions support. My solution comes with java language. I use ItelliJ IDEA CE as my IDE, and Java 8.

You can find solution itself in `solution` folder. You can find test outputs and expectations in `tests` folder. There is also `minified` folder, it contains exactly the same code, but 1 file only. I was only allowed to submit 1 file.

Challenge was not free, and I should get paid $500 for this.

### Challenge description

Since you can't copy from HackerRank page (and I was too lazy to disable JavaScript), here are few screenshots. It's a full challenge description.
